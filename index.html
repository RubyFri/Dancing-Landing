<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>Sometimes, people are sad, and that sucks a lot. But do you know what doesn't suck, dancing! That's why we created the Dancing Queens (and we are not even 17!) Essentially, you pay us the very very low cheap and affordable rate of 400 dollars per hour to dance for you until you feel cheered up again! We do not offer financial aid for our services because of how super cheap they are. </p>
