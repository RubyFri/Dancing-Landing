      <p>
        Sometimes, people are sad, and that sucks a lot. But do you know what
        doesn't suck? Dancing! That's why we created the Dancing Queens (and we
        are not even 17!) Essentially, you pay us the very very low cheap and
        affordable rate of 400 dollars per hour to dance for you until you feel
        cheered up again! We do not offer financial aid for our services because
        of how super cheap they are.

      <p> This site was designed and published as part of the COMP 333 Software Engineering class at Wesleyan University. This is an exercise.
          However, if you think this is a good business venture please do let us know and we will maybe make it happen! Peace and love.
