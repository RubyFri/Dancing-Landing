      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes, people are sad, and that sucks a lot. But do you know what
        doesn't suck? Dancing! That's why we created the Dancing Queens (and we
        are not even 17!) Essentially, you pay us the very very low cheap and
        affordable rate of 400 dollars per hour to dance for you until you feel
        cheered up again! We do not offer financial aid for our services because
        of how super cheap they are.
      </p>
